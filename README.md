Hollywood and TV-show inspired attack and hacking simulator.

Open `index.html` in a browser to run the simulator.
The page displays scrolling logs, a world map with attack traces and firewall breach indicators.
Explore the fictional file browser and use the "Deploy Countermeasure" button to reset attacks.

## CLI Mode

Run `python cli.py` for a text-based version of the simulator.
Type `counter` to deploy countermeasures or `exit` to quit the program.
