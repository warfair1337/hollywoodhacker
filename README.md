Hollywood and TV-show inspired cyber ops command center.

- Open `index.html` in a browser to launch a neon‑soaked, cinematic UI.
- Watch realistic attack arcs animate across a world map, with radar sweeps, glow effects, and dynamic threat levels.
- Interact with the file vault and deploy countermeasures via the control panel.

Notes:
- The CLI mode has been removed in this rewrite. The experience is now fully visual and browser‑based.
